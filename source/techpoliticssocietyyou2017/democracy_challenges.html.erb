    <% detail_paragraphs: ['Problem statement: Cyber criminals have stolen most voter\'s personal identity info (PII). They can use the PII to impersonate you to your state\'s online voter registration (OVR) system. Your election officials can\'t do much about it, because they\'re not able to actually authenticate you. With other nations attacking our elections, the potential for broad consequences is real.', 'The technology to fix this problem has been around for a while, but out of reach of reach for state and local governments to use with citizens, and impeded by end-user usability problems. But now it\'s possible for ordinary people to use these existing methods -- token based cryptographically strong two-factor authentication -- repackaged for everyday use with services like Gmail. It\'s a recently proven solution to recently demonstrated problems with SMS hacking and phone hijacking for criminals to work around the "access code text message" routine to steal millions of dollars in bitcoin.', 'Governments won\'t (and shouldn\'t) rely on Google to authenticate citizens to government services, but the underlying technology is available to anyone to use. It\'s not specific to Google https://fidoalliance.org/and open source software is available to set up the system.', 'There\'s one last hurdle though: state OVR systems weren\'t built for FIDO, and there\'s scant willingness, funding, and resources to change that.', 'The challenge is to overcome that last hurdle by creating a reference implementation of an open source OVR web front end that uses real FIDO based strong authentication, with a public demonstration system that people can really use. Once there is a real running systems with publicly available code, it will be much easier for real OVR operators to understand how easy it can be to enable their voters to protect their right to vote with the strongest protection for their online voter registration.', 'And to kick up a notch, there\'s one more step past existing OVR on the web - extend existing open source OVR with a web services interface, to support creation of mobile voter app that can access your voter record to provide notifications and updates on election deadlines, schedules, locations, and more.'], %>

  <% main_text: '2. Blockchain Your Voting Eligibility', %>
  <% detail_paragraphs: ['In most U.S. states, your ability to vote depends on having a validvoter registration on record with your correct information. Ensuring that has never been easy for many voters, but now we know that we\'revulnerable for foreign election meddling including voter identity theft enabled by widespread consumer privacy breaches.', 'Whether it\'s cyber-pranksters, serious spooks, clerical errors, faulty voter list management, or voter\'s misunderstanding of what "current" actually means, there\'s a wide range of reasons why your voter record can change without your knowing. A few really knowledgable voters who are fortunate enough to have access to online voter registration may well respond to prompts from voter engagement groups to go ahead and navigate a clunky government web site to double check their voting eligibility, in time to fix any problems.', '
Why isn\'t it as easy for anyone to sign up for notifications about their voter registration as it is for credit notifications or changes to your Amazon account? Isn\'t there an easy fix? Not quite -- there is still a challenge to solve. Publications of voter registration lists are controlled by a patchwork of privacy laws and appropriate use regulations that create a real burden for election officials and the public alike. But the notification that\'s useful for the voter doesn\'t require complete voter records, in fact nothing more than the public information on voters\' names and addresses that anyone can see on election day. Why don\'t election officials offer a notification service for voter registration changes? Partly lack of requirement to do so, and funding and resource constraints. But also because the notifications need to protected from spoofing, tampering, and other disruption that election meddlers are more than capable of.', 'Enter the challenge to be addressed with blockchain technology. Every
day inside the depths of voter registration systems, a voter\'s record is changed, and the change logged. There\'s a little nugget of potentially public information: "Today, there was a change of mailing address for voter Jane Doe of 1234 El Camino Road." How to get that out and protected from meddling? A conceptually simple system that uses hashchains and cryptocurrency to create a publicly visibile, government controlled tamperproof ledger of voter registration changes. From there, any number of NGOs can deliver notification services based on the open public data. The challenge: use existing open source tools for blockchains and ledgers to create an open source reference implementation that will show government IT groups exactly how it\'s done, without the need to write a line code. Integrate it with a demo system of an open source online voter registration tool that people can see touch and try.'], %>
